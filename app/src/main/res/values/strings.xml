        You just woke up from a scary dream.
        \nAs you open your eyes you look around and you find yourself trapped into a small dark room.
        \nThe room is empty and on the other side of the room you see a shadow with large green eyes looking at you.
        \nSuddenly the shadow starts speaking:
        \nHello stranger.
        \nI am Zurtok the mighty and you are my prisoner.
        \nIf you want to leave this room alive you must answer correctly my six questions.
        \nIf you fail you will die...\n
        You can however choose the category of the answers. \nDecide wisely as your life depends on it....

        As long as you chose the category the shadow split into peaces.
        \nIt changed to all kinds of shapes and sizes.
        \nFrom tall temples to maps and tools.
        \Even though the green eyes, that stood at you, disappeared you can still feel the ill intentions of the shadow...
        \nOnce again Zurtok\'s voice spread through the room, this time coming from all the peaces together.

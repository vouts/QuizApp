        You just woke up from a scary dream.
        \nAs you open your eyes you look around and you find yourself trapped into a small dark room.
        \nThe room is empty and on the other side you see a shadow with large green eyes staring down at you.
        \nSuddenly the shadow starts speaking:
        \nHello stranger.
        \nI am Zurtok the mighty and you are my prisoner.
        \nIf you want to leave this room alive you must answer six questions correctly.
